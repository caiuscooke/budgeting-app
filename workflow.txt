Make a new branch in VSCode and publish that branch before you make changes.
Make any new changes to the code via that branch.
When you are done making changes, push the commits to github via that branch.
Navigate to the project on github.com and click on the branch you were working on.
Click the button that says "create pull request"
Give a description and click create 

Then after you does that I will go github.com, review and merge the request and delete that branch.
You will then in vscode switch back to the main branch and run
git fetch
git remote prune origin
git branch -d <branch_name>

Then rinse and repeat for any new changes
